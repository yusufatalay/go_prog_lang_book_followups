Everyone has heard the phrase that hard work is the path to success. Not everyone abides by this sentiment. There are always examples of people who try to succeed through the path of least resistance. In Nikolai Gogol's novel Dead Souls, the protagonist, Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, tries to take the easy path to success but finds it fraught with difficulties.

Chichikov isn't the only person in the novel trying to make easy money. The landowners, who own the serfs, or servants, haven't worked a day in their life. The serfs care for the land and it is their work that earns the landowners money. When these serfs die, they are considered dead souls, yet still count among the living on the census. Chichikov tries to help the landowners by purchasing these dead souls.

Chichikov arrives in a town that Gogol simply calls ''N''. Chichikov plans to buy dead souls and then collect them for his own eventual gain. Basically, he wants to create the illusion that he is wealthy. Although these transactions prove comical, it is also demonstrates how greedy people can be. There is nothing to be gained from selling these dead souls (or buying them) other than to remove them from their census. The landowners, however, are compelled to extract every last cent possible from their estates.
